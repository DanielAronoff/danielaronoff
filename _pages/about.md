I am a Research Affiliate at the MIT Department of Economics, a Research Associate at the Laboratory for Economic Analysis and Design at MIT, and a Collaborator at the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative. 

My primary research focus is at the intersection of economics and cryptography, including blockchain protocol design, the study of stablecoins, and environmental market mechanisms. I have also published two books on the 2008 global financial crisis.
